## Technologies used in this project
- MongoDB (noSQL database)
- Express.js (Node.js API module)
- Mongoose (MongoDB modeling tool)
- React.js
- Jest (for js) and supertest (for API)
<br/>


## How to launch website
1. Clone project and install dependencies
```terminal
git clone https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/mikaek/firenews
npm install
```

2. Start API server (from command line)
```terminal
cd api 
node start.js
```
3. Start react server (from command line)
````terminal
npm start
````
<br/>

## Structure 
### Layout
The website uses the same layout around the content for all pages, expect the 404 page not found page. Therefore I made a layout component which includes:
- Side-navigation
- Newsfeed
- Floating action button (mobile only)
- Top navigation (desktop only)

This component also switches between mobile- and desktop-layout if the width of the page goes under/over a certain breakpoint. 

The benefit of using a layout is that you only have to declare it once in the top application, and then render all children (content) inside it.

### Page routing
I used **react-router** for loading components on different urls on the site. Some routes use the layout component, therefore I made a **RouteWithLayout** component which integrates both components into one. This is necessary since wrapping the layout component with the router component will render the layout around all routes on the site.
````javascript
<RouteWithLayout 
    path='/article/:id' 
    render={(props) => <Article {...props} data={articleData} />}
/>
````
In the example above, the article component will only be rendered if the url-path is /article/some-id. The layout component will also be rendered around the content in the article component. 

*Note: if the article is not found with the given id in the database, the page will redirect to the 404 page not found page using the **Redirect** component from react-router.*
````javascript
// Redirect to 404 page is article does not exist
if (props.data && article === null) 
    return <Redirect to='/404' />
````
<br/>

### Styling components
Instead of using seperate .css files, I chose to use the **styled-components** package. The great thing with styled-components is that you can have the styling in the same file as the jsx (works best for smaller components). Styled-components also allows javascript inline with css, which can be used for more dynamic and complex styling. 

Props can also be passed, in almost the same way as a normal react component.

*Example from project:*

**1. Create styled component**
````javascript
const WarningText = styled.p`
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: #EB7C74;
    display: ${props => props.show ? 'block' : 'none'};
`;
````

**2. Use in component jsx**
````javascript
<WarningText show={props.inputs['title'].warning}>
    Title is required
</WarningText>
````
<br/>

### Lazy loading, please wait...
If fetching the data takes longer than rendering the components, it is a better UX if the 'outline' of components is rendered without any content. This gives the user an idea of the layout of the site, and what can be expected when the data loads. It is also much better than a blank screen!
To achieve this effect I used a package called **react-loading-skeleton**. 
````javascript
// Render skeleton component if title is not defined
<Title>{props.title || <Skeleton count={2}/>}</Title>
````
*This is how the article looks with a delay before fetching data*

### React Hooks!
I decided to use one of the new features recently (nov. 2019) introduced in React, called hooks. I did not create any custom hooks for the project due to limited time, but I used the some of the hooks provided with React.

**useState hook** allows previously 'stateless' components to have a state. Therefore a class is not required to create a component with a state. 
````javascript
// Current category
const [category, setCategory] = useState('Main');

// States that hold data
const [articleData, setArticleData] = useState([]);
const [categoryData, setCategoryData] = useState([]);
````

**useEffect hook** from React.js [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html): 
>  If youâ€™re familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.
````javascript
// Fetch data when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
````
