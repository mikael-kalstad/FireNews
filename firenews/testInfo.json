    "content": "Across the burning Amazon, smoke is rising and fine particles of charcoal are falling softly to the ground. At last count, more than 93,000 fires were alight in the Brazilian Amazon, up more than 60 percent from the same time last year, and the highest number since 2010. According to NASA, this year’s fires are more intense than in previous years, too.But Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has only been keeping fire records since 1998, and two decades isn’t long in the life of a forest where trees live for centuries and humans have been setting fires for millennia.Paleoecology—the study of ancient environments—offers unique insights into how the first Amazonian peoples manipulated fire in the landscape, the effects of those fires on the forest’s ecology over time, and lessons that might help to prevent modern fires.Layers of charcoal buried below the rainforest’s surface reveal that for thousands of years, the Amazon’s ancient inhabitants used fire to clear the forest floor for agriculture—and that it had a lasting effect, making those areas more fire prone today. But unlike many of the current fires, set to flatten the forest entirely, those indigenous fire practices left trees standing.",

    "title": "Why working long hours benefit no one",
    "content": "During the war, Britain needed to manufacture weapons and ammunition quickly. Because so many men were off fighting, women – who had not typically worked in factories at the time – were called into service as munitionettes. Their work included tasks like drilling screw threads on parts of weapons before they were assembled, and turning fuse bodies, which likely meant turning a piece of metal as a machine cut it and bore holes in it. In 1915, the government established the Health of Munition Workers Committee (HMWC) to monitor working conditions and advise on matters such as working hours. The committee managed to collect a rich set of data that can tell us a lot about what happens when people work long hours.The information is especially useful because of the nature of the work and the workers: there was only one shift, and each worker did the same tasks, which were easy to count. The committee could verify which days and hours they worked by looking at the factory's electricity logs. Because the information is unambiguous and measurable, it's great data for researchers.",
